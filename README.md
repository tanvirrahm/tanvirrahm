- Applied Layer 2 and Layer 3 networking concepts in a simulated enterprise environment.

### 2. **Security Audit**  
**Source**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- Conducted a comprehensive security audit for a simulated enterprise setup.  
- Identified vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation strategies.

### 3. **SOC Lab Creation**  
**Source**: Let's Defend  
- Built a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) lab.  
- Configured monitoring tools and practiced real-world threat detection and incident response workflows.

### 4. [**Azure Security Lab Portfolio**](https://github.com/tanvirrahm/Azure-Sentinel-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence) 
- **VM Setup**: Created a honeypot Windows VM on Azure and enabled logging of failed login attempts.  
- **Logging & KQL**: Set up Microsoft Sentinel and Log Analytics Workspace. Used KQL to analyze Event ID 4625 (failed login attempts).  
- **Enrichment**: Imported `geoip-summarized.csv` to enrich IP logs with location data.  
- **Visualization**: Created a custom Sentinel workbook with an interactive attack map.  
📂 *GitHub Repo:* _Coming Soon_

### 5. [**Splunk Enterprise Deployment Project**](https://github.com/tanvirrahm/Splunk-Enterprise-Deployment-Project) 
- Deployed Splunk Enterprise on a controller VM and three agent VMs with Universal Forwarders.  
- Configured `inputs.conf` and `outputs.conf` for proper data flow and log indexing.  
- Used Splunk Web UI for log search, alerts, and dashboard visualization.  
- Resolved setup issues and improved performance with Splunk Linux add-ons.
